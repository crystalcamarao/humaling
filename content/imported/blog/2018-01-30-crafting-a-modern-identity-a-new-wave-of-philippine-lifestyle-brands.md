What does a country’s craftsmanship signify? The first thing that comes to mind is its longstanding traditions, as the result of an artistic heritage handed down through centuries. In the Philippines, these certainly hold true – with the country being a known exporter of everything from mats, baskets, and ethnic fabrics all over the world. Yet in hindsight, this might also signify a lower sense of economic importance.

In a study conducted by Erasmus University Rotterdam in the Netherlands, they describe the emergent thought of craftsmanship being deemed a lower art form compared to conceptual innovation in higher-income nations.

“The educational systems in developed countries sanctified intellectual intelligence and looked down on manual skills. In the arts conceptual innovation had overtaken craftsmanship as the core competence.” In other words, highly unique and conceptual products (including everything from haute couture to smartphones) proved to be of higher value than mere souvenir goods.

Yet in the case of the Philippines, craftsmanship seems to become more and more tied into the uplifting of the local lifestyle - as well as the communities that make them, and even national identity. With such visions in place, the idea of balancing conceptual innovation and manual craftsmanship can be seen in the works of Filipino designers. This could prove to be not only beneficial in creating better-looking handicrafts, but in uplifting the lives of the local communities that make them as well.

We take a look at the most exciting contemporary brands committed to giving the Philippines the spotlight in the world of global craftsmanship.

**1.Kenneth Cobonpue**

A multi-awarded furniture designer and manufacturer from Cebu, Cobonpue is known for taking Philippine craftsmanship into the international arena. And [rightfully so](https://humaling.com/the-magic-of-material-the-renowned-designs-of-kenneth-cobonpue/) - his home pieces manage to twist, turn, and tame a wide variety of locally sourced materials, even being dubbed “Rattan’s First Virtuoso” by TIME Magazine back in 2006.

**5. Team Manila**

While many Filipino lifestyle brands take inspiration from the country’s cultural heritage – Team Manila on the other hand finds its muse in the lifestyle, culture, and imagery of Manila (sometimes even poking fun at the quirks of living in the Philippine capital).

With shirts, totes, pouches, limited edition prints, artwork, and other lifestyle accessories that elevate the mundane and everyday, and honor beloved national icons, Team Manila offers everything for everyone.
