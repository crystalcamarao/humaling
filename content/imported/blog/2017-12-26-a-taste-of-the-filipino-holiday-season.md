Around the world, many cultures celebrate the holidays as a time of plenty – with the dinner table being the centerpiece of every gathering. Here in the Philippines, this sentiment echoes through every household, as families prepare the most special meals they couldn’t normally eat for the rest of the year. But how do Filipinos exactly celebrate Christmas and the New Year on the dinner table?

&nbsp;

** **Held on Christmas Eve, the Noche Buena is a night-long celebration where Filipinos stay up late to await the following Christmas Day. No matter the economic background, it is a feast that comprises of a variety of decadent and hearty food. These include everything from store-bought staples like hamon and quezo de bola, as well as home-cooked specialties like caldereta, morcon, and embutido.

**New Year: The Media Noche**

** **Wonder how Filipinos celebrate as they count down to the New Year? It’s with none other than the Media Noche, a food and fireworks-filled tradition that extends from the dinner table to the street. The Media Noche menu usually comprises of something similar to the Noche Buena – everything from delicious hamon, to the large bowls of fruit salad can easily be enjoyed during this occasion.

Still, there are a couple of unique practices during the Media Noche: these include having a 12-round fruit centerpiece (as round fruits symbolize prosperity throughout the whole year), making noise with the torotot (horns), setting off fireworks and firecracker fountains on the street, as well as wearing polka-dotted clothes (to again attract prosperity as polka dots resemble coins).

**The Filipino Holiday Menu**

With the tradition of Christmas introduced to the Philippines by the Spaniards, it can be no surprise to see a wide range of Spanish dishes set on Filipino holiday tables. Take a look at these several festive dishes and desserts often served during these 2 special occasions.
