Global cinema is a competition of popularity and prestige – it’s common knowledge that Hollywood and European films usually take the crown for both. Go further East however, and you’ll find an exciting scene that has emerged in Philippine cinema, evolving from the box-office norm of poorly made slapstick and romantic comedies.

Still, that hasn’t stopped the rise of an independent film movement, in part due to easier access to digital filmmaking tools, and the launch of government or privately-funded festivals (such as [Cinemalaya](http://www.cinemalaya.org/), [CineFilipino](http://cinefilipino.com/), and [Cinema One Originals](https://www.facebook.com/CinemaOneOriginals/)). International acclaim has helped as well, with Brillante Mendoza and Lav Diaz arguably being two of the most prolific directors as of date. Winning awards from Cannes to Venice, and elsewhere, take a look at how these two men have helped put the Philippine film industry on the global map.
