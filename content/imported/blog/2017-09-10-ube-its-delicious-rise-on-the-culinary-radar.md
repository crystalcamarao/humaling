Is this craze about to unseat matcha’s global popularity? While that can’t be said for sure, it’s a fact that Filipinos have long been snacking and craving ube. It is inextricably linked to the country’s [rich culinary history](http://cnnphilippines.com/life/leisure/food/2016/10/14/ube-cover-story.html), grown by the natives long before the arrival of the Spaniards. Today however, this food is transformed into everything from ube ice cream to hopia - foods enjoyed at Christmas dinners, fiestas, and as simple everyday fare. Take a look at the sheer variety of ube snacks and desserts Pinoys love below.

&nbsp;

**1. Ube Halaya or Ube Jam**

** **A favorite delicacy among Filipinos, [ube halaya](http://www.yummy.ph/recipe/ube-halaya-recipe), or ube jam is made from boiled and mashed purple yam combined with condensed milk and butter into a thick mixture. It is often eaten on its own, or used in ice-cold desserts such as halo-halo.

Want to stash jars of these in your fridge? You can cook it from scratch, by buying the ube in any local market – or get the store-bought version at the local food aisle at any big Filipino supermarket.

One renowned variant is the [Mountain Maid Ube Jam](http://www.philstar.com/food-and-leisure/2014/04/03/1308015/mountain-maid-mountain-made), made up north at the Good Shepherd Convent in Baguio City. Crafted with only the highest quality butter, milk, and ube sourced from the nearby Benguet and Ilocos provinces, Filipinos will likely mention this beloved brand when asked about ube halaya.

** **A flaky Filipino-Chinese snack, ube hopia is a addictive fusion of purple yam baked inside a thin, pie crust-like shell. Each bite begs for more, with one’s fingers getting all oily from the pork lard used in most recipes.

One popular ube hopia brand is Eng Bee Tin, a Chinese specialty food store with branches and kiosks found in Manila’s Chinatown, and all over the capital.
